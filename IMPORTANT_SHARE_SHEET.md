# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Share Your Google Sheet

## Before using the application, you MUST share your Google Sheet with the service account!

### Service Account Email:
```
asset-database@asset-database-477316.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Steps to Share:

1. Open your Google Sheet:
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9jfezVWpFYAmvjo81Lk788kf9DNwqvSx7yxHWRGkec/edit

2. Click the **"Share"** button (top right corner)

3. Paste this email address:
   ```
   asset-database@asset-database-477316.iam.gserviceaccount.com
   ```

4. Set permission to **"Editor"**

5. Click **"Share"**

6. **Uncheck** "Notify people" (optional, since it's a service account)

### Why This is Required:

The application needs permission to read and write data to your Google Sheet. Without sharing, you'll get "Permission denied" errors.

### Verify It's Working:

After sharing, restart the application and try to register/login. If it works, you're all set!
